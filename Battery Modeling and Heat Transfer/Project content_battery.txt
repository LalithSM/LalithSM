Project Title: Simulation and Analysis of Battery Thermal Management Using ANSYS Fluent

Objective:
The primary objective of this project was to simulate and analyze the thermal behavior of lithium-polymer batteries and battery packs using ANSYS Fluent. The focus was on understanding the effects of electrode configuration, discharge rates, and cooling mechanisms on the thermal performance and efficiency of the battery systems.

Introduction:
With the increasing global energy demand and the need for environmentally friendly energy solutions, optimizing battery performance has become crucial. The Battery Thermal Management System (BTMS) plays a vital role in maintaining battery safety, efficiency, and longevity by ensuring the battery operates within a safe temperature range. This project aims to analyze the thermal behavior of lithium-polymer batteries and develop strategies to enhance their performance through effective cooling techniques.

Methodology:

Battery Model Setup:

Single Cell Battery:
Modeled the battery cell using dimensions and constants from the research paper by U.S. Kim et al.
Simulated the battery's thermal behavior using the Multi-Scale Multi-Domain (MSMD) battery model in ANSYS Fluent.
Performed simulations for different discharge rates and analyzed the thermal response without cooling.

Battery Pack:
Assembled a 1P3S battery pack configuration using three similar battery cells connected in series.
Simulated the thermal behavior of the battery pack under real-time application conditions.

Meshing and Geometry:
Created detailed geometric models and generated meshes for both the single battery cell and the battery pack using ANSYS Design Modeller.

Simulation Procedure:
Set up the simulation environment in ANSYS Fluent by enabling the battery and energy models.
Defined conductive zones and electric contacts for the battery components.
Assigned material properties to different zones and set appropriate boundary conditions.
Ran simulations for both "without cooling" (h=0) and "with cooling" (h=20) conditions.
Analyzed the results by observing temperature distributions, potential variations, and current density vectors.

Results Paragraph:
The simulation results highlighted the critical impact of thermal management on battery performance. Without cooling, the temperature of the battery cells and the pack increased significantly, leading to potential thermal runaway and reduced efficiency. Introducing forced convection cooling effectively reduced the temperature, improving the current density and overall battery performance. The maximum temperature of the single cell decreased from 308K to 298.6K with cooling, while the battery pack showed a reduction from 312K to 300.4K. The current density also increased, indicating better power output and efficiency. These findings emphasize the importance of effective thermal management systems in extending battery life and enhancing performance.
